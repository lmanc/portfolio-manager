# Roadmap üöÄ
- Implement a mechanism using a public API to retrieve print names and daily closing values for assets.
- Improve logging by replacing print statements in `except` blocks with appropriate logging functions.
- Enhance the `currency` property to support changes and ensure that changing it affects the values inside the portfolio.
- Use Plotly Dash for data visualization.

# Improvements üõ†Ô∏è
- All imports need proper refactoring. üíÄ
- Consider if it's worth using abstract classes and methods, e.g., `Portfolio` should probably be an abstract class; similar consideration should be given to all the various methods that raise `NotImplementedError`. ü§î
- Set up proper GitHub Actions. ü¶ë

# Usage
The default usage is as follows:

```python
from degiroportfolio import DegiroPortfolio
from portfolio_manager import PortfolioManager

pf = DegiroPortfolio()
pm = PortfolioManager(pf)
```

`DegiroPortfolio` takes two optional keyword arguments: `assets_file` and `allocation_file`. By default, these are set to `assets.csv` and `allocation.csv`, respectively, which must be in the same directory as the project.

## Sell Rebalance

To perform a sell rebalance, run:

```python
from degiroportfolio import DegiroPortfolio
from portfolio_manager import PortfolioManager

pf = DegiroPortfolio()
pm = PortfolioManager(pf)

pm.rebalance_sell()
```

## No-sell Rebalance

To perform a no-sell rebalance, run:

```python
from degiroportfolio import DegiroPortfolio
from portfolio_manager import PortfolioManager

pf = DegiroPortfolio()
pm = PortfolioManager(pf)

pm.rebalance_no_sell()
```

## `assets.csv` and `allocation.csv` Required Format

`assets_file` must have the second column filled with ISINs, which will then be used as the `Index` of the assets `DataFrame` inside the`Portfolio` object. `allocation_file` must have two columns with the ISINs and the desired percentages. Any subclass of `Portfolio` should be implemented accordingly. For examples of how they should be formatted, see the `assets.csv` and `allocations.csv` in `tests/csv`.
